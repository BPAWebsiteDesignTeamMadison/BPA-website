Delete all of the "Find out all you need to know about this years national leadership conference"

For "Event info goes here", put "Find out all you need to know about NLC 2020"
For "Travel info goes here", put "Get hotels and other traveling needs here"
For "Tourism...", put "Come look at museums, hotels, monuments, and other important National Landmarks"
For "Transportation...", put "Make sure you know your way around Washington D.C."

If you're going to make other pages, here's what I would think would look good
  Event Info: Just have the a big title (this would go on every page) that is the same as the tab name, so "Event Info"
    Put this:
      "When: May 6-10, 2020
      Where: Washington DC
      Specific Location: TBA
      
      Be ready to recieve more info on next year's NLC as the date gets closer!"
      (lines 11-15 are all text inside the website)
   Travel Info: Put this:
      "Find hotels in Washington DC"
      (if you can, implement a map of Washington DC)
   Tourism:
       Put these buttons: Monuments, Museums, Federal Buildings
       That might be all we need right now, but if you can, make a page for each button
   Transportation:
        Put these buttons: Metro, Taxi Services, Bus Lines, Lift Services
